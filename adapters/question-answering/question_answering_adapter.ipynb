    "\n",
    "The interest is obvious: if you need models for different NLP tasks, instead of fine-tuning and storing one model by NLP task, **you store only one MLM model and the trained tasks adapters which sizes are about 1% (QA adapter) and 8% (Lang+QA adapters) of the MLM model one** (it depends of the choosen adapter configuration). More, the loading of these adapters in production is very easy."

This is very important as we consider the metric when selecting a model, not the loss. Therefore, we decided to launch this script inside the notebook [question_answering_adapter_script.ipynb](https://github.com/piegu/language-models/blob/master/adapters/question-answering/question_answering_adapter_script.ipynb) (by simulating terminal command line) instead of running code in cells as done in the HF notebook. \n",

Buff (carne de búfalo Marinho) é muito comum. Há uma forte tradição de consumo de buffs em Katmandu, especialmente entre Newars, que não é encontrado em outras partes do Nepal. O consumo de carne de porco era considerado tabu até algumas décadas atrás. Devido à mistura com a cozinha Kirat do leste do Nepal, a carne de porco encontrou um lugar nos pratos de Katmandu. Uma população marginal de hindus e muçulmanos devotos o considera tabu. Os muçulmanos proíbem comer buff a partir do Alcorão, enquanto os hindus comem todas as variedades, exceto a carne de vaca, pois consideram a vaca uma deusa e símbolo da pureza.

Esses pontos quentes evaporam mais rápido que o restante do filamento, o que aumenta a resistência naquele momento - isso cria um feedback positivo que termina no pequeno espaço familiar em um filamento de aparência saudável. Irving Langmuir descobriu que um gás inerte, em vez de vácuo, retardaria a evaporação.

Ao sul, é delimitado pelo Sahel, um cinturão de savana tropical semi-árida ao redor do vale do rio Níger e da região do Sudão da África Subsaariana.
