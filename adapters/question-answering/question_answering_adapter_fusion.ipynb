    "The objective here is to **fine-tune a Masked Language Model (MLM) like BERT (base or large) for a QA task by training adapters (library [adapter-transformers](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers)) on its Fusion mode, not the embeddings and transformers layers of the MLM model**, and to compare results with BERT model fully fine-tune for the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest is obvious: if you need models for different NLP tasks, instead of fine-tuning and storing one model by NLP task, **you store only one MLM model and the trained tasks adapters which sizes are between 1% (QA adapter) and 8% (Lang+QA adapters) of the MLM model one** (it depends of the choosen adapter configuration). **With the fusion mode, there is one more adapter by layer (the fusion adapter) that raises the number of adapter parameters from 23.5% (QA+NER adapters) to 31% (LANG+QA+NER adapters).** More, the loading of these adapters in production is very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference here with our others notebooks about Question-Answering (QA) with Adapters (see our folder [question-answering](https://github.com/piegu/language-models/tree/master/adapters/question-answering) in github) is **the use of the Fusion mode**: instead of training only a task adapter on QA (with or without a lang adapter), we've trained a fusion adapter in QA that will make a weighted composite of the parameters of the adapters added to our model. **The idea here is not just to kepp all knowledge from other tasks, but to compose with it.**"

Therefore, we decided to launch this script inside the notebook [question_answering_adapter_script.ipynb](https://github.com/piegu/language-models/blob/master/adapters/question-answering/question_answering_adapter_script.ipynb) (by simulating terminal command line) instead of running code in cells as done in the HF notebook. \n",
