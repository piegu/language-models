    "The objective here is to **fine-tune a Masked Language Model (MLM) like BERT (base or large) by training adapters (library [adapter-transformers](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers)), not the embeddings and transformers layers of the MLM model**, and to compare results with BERT model fully fine-tune for the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest is obvious: if you need models for different NLP tasks, instead of fine-tuning and storing one model by NLP task, **you store only one MLM model and the trained tasks adapters which sizes are between 6% and 13% of the MLM model one** (it depends of the choosen adapter configuration). More, the loading of these adapters in production is very easy."

Os folículos se conectam ao ducto deferente pelo ducto efferens, e os dois vasos tubulares deferentes se conectam a um ducto ejaculatório mediano que leva ao exterior. Uma porção do ducto deferente é frequentemente aumentada para formar a vesícula seminal, que armazena o esperma antes de serem descarregados na fêmea. As vesículas seminais têm revestimentos glandulares que secretam nutrientes para nutrição e manutenção do esperma. O ducto ejaculatório é derivado de uma invaginação das células epidérmicas durante o desenvolvimento e, como resultado, possui um revestimento cuticular. A porção terminal do ducto ejaculatório pode ser esclerotizada para formar o órgão intromitente, o edema.

Da mesma forma, em circuitos de menor escala, a faísca pode não ser suficiente para danificar o comutador, mas ainda irradia interferência de radiofrequência indesejável (RFI), absorvida por um capacitor de filtro.

We could do it as a pre-processing step (like the tokenization) but then the tokens would always be masked the same way at each epoch.
