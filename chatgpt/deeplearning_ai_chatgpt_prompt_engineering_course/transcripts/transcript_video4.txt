There's so much text in today's world, pretty much none of us have 
enough time to read all the things we wish we had time to. So one 
of the most exciting applications I've seen of 
large language models is to use it to 
summarise text. And this is something that I'm seeing multiple teams 
build into multiple software applications. You can do this 
in the Chat GPT Web Interface. I do this all 
the time to summarise articles so I can just kind of read the content of many 
more articles than I previously could. And if 
you want to do this more programmatically, you'll see how to 
in this lesson. So with that, let's dig into the code to 
see how you could use this yourself to summarise text. 
So let's start off with the same starter code as you saw 
before of importOpenAI, load the API key and here's that 
getCompletion helper function. 
I'm going to use as the running example, the 
task of summarising this product review. Got 
this panda plush toy from a daughter's birthday 
who loves it and takes it everywhere and so on 
and so on. If you're building an e-commerce website 
and there's just a large volume of reviews, having 
a tool to summarise the lengthy reviews could 
give you a way to very quickly glance 
over more reviews to get a better sense of what all your 
customers are thinking. So here's a 
prompt for generating a summary. Your task is to generate a 
short summary of a product review from e-commerce websites, summarise 
the review below and so on in at 
most 30 words. 
And so this is soft and cute panda plush toy loved by 
a daughter but small to the price, arrived early. Not bad, it's 
a pretty good summary. And as you saw in the previous video, you 
can also play with things like controlling the character 
count or the number of sentences to affect the length of this 
summary. Now, sometimes when creating a summary, if 
you have a very specific purpose in mind 
for the summary, for example, if you want to give feedback 
to the shipping department, you can also modify the prompt to 
reflect that so that it can generate a summary that is more 
applicable to one particular group in 
your business. So, for example, if I add to give feedback 
to the 
shipping department, 
let's say I change this to start to focus on 
any aspects that mention. 
shipping and delivery of the product. And if I run this, then 
again, you get a summary, but instead of starting 
off with Soft and Cute Panda Plush Toy, 
it now focuses on the fact that it arrived a day earlier 
than expected. And then it still has, you know, other details. Or 
as another example, if we aren't trying to give feedback 
to the shipping department, but let's say we want to give feedback 
to the pricing department. 
So the pricing department is 
responsible for determining the price of the product. 
And 
I'm going to tell it to focus on 
any aspects that are relevant to the price and perceived value. 
Then this generates a different summary 
that says maybe the price may be too high for its size. Now, 
in the summaries that I've generated for the 
shipping department or the pricing department, it 
focuses a bit more on information relevant to 
those specific departments. And in fact, feel free to pause 
the video now and maybe ask it to generate information for the 
product department responsible for the customer 
experience of the product. 
Or for something else that you think might 
be related to an e-commerce site. 
But in these summaries, even though it 
generated the information relevant to shipping, 
it had some other information too, which you could decide may 
or may not be hopeful. 
So depending on how you want to summarize it, 
you can also ask it to extract information 
rather than summarize it. So here's a prompt that says you're tasked 
to extract relevant information to give 
feedback to the shipping department. And now it just says 
product arrived the day earlier than expected without all 
of the other information, which was 
also hopeful in the general summary, but less 
specific to the shipping department if all it wants to know is 
what happened with the shipping. 
Lastly, let me just share with you a concrete 
example for how to use this in a workflow to help summarize 
multiple reviews to make them easier to read. 
So, here are a few reviews. This is kind of long, but you know, 
here's the second review for a standing lamp, needle 
lamp on the bedroom. Here's the third review for an 
electric toothbrush. My dental hygienist recommended it. Kind of 
a long review about an electric toothbrush. This is 
a review for a blender when they said, so, so that 
17 piece system on seasonal sale and so 
on and so on. This is actually a lot of text. If you 
want, feel free to pause the video and read through all 
this text. But what if you want to know what these reviewers 
wrote without having to stop and read all this in detail. So 
I'm going to set review 1 
to be just the product review that we had up there. And 
I'm going to put all of these reviews into a list. And 
now if I implement a 
for loop over the reviews. 
So here's my prompt and here I've asked it to summarize it in 
at most 20 words. Then let's have it 
get the response and print it out. And let's run that. 
And it prints out the first review was that Pantatoi 
review, summary review of the lamp, summary review of the toothbrush, 
and then the blender. 
And so if you have 
a website where you have hundreds of reviews, 
you can imagine how you might use this 
to build a dashboard to take huge numbers of reviews, 
generate short summaries of them so that 
you or someone else can browse the reviews much more quickly. 
And then if they wish, maybe click in to 
see the original longer review. And this can help 
you efficiently get a better sense of what 
all of your customers are thinking. 
Right. So that's it for summarizing. And I hope that you can picture if you 
have any applications with many pieces of text, how 
you can use prompts like these to summarize 
them to help people quickly get a sense of what's in 
the text, the many pieces of text, and perhaps 
optionally dig in more if they wish. 
In the next video, we'll look at another capability 
of large language models, which is to make inferences using text. For 
example, what if you had, again, product reviews and you 
wanted to very quickly get a sense of which product reviews have 
a positive or a negative sentiment? Let's take a look at how to do 
that in the next video.
