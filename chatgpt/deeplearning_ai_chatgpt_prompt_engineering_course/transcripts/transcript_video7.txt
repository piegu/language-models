Expanding is the task of taking a short piece of text, 
such as a set of instructions or a list of topics, 
and having the large language model generate a 
longer piece of text, such as an email or 
an essay about some topic. There are some great uses of this, 
such as if you use a large language model as a brainstorming partner. 
But I just also want to acknowledge that 
there are some problematic use cases of this, 
such as if someone were to use it, they generate a large amount of spam. 
So when you use these capabilities of a large language model, 
please use it only in a responsible way and in 
a way that helps people. 
In this video we'll go through an example of how you can 
use a language model to generate a personalized 
email based on some information. The 
email is kind of self-proclaimed to be from an AI 
bot which as Andrew mentioned is very important. 
We're also going to use another one of the models input 
parameters called temperature and this kind of allows 
you to vary the kind of degree of exploration and variety in 
the kind of models responses. So let's get into it. 
So before we get started we're going to kind of 
do the usual setup. So set up the OpenAI Python package and then also define 
our helper function getCompletion 
and now we're going to write a custom email response to 
a customer review and so given a customer review and the sentiment 
we're going to generate a custom response. Now we're 
going to use the language model to generate a custom 
email to a customer based on a customer 
review and the sentiment of the review. So we've already 
extracted the sentiment 
using the kind of prompts that we saw 
in the inferring video 
and then this is the customer review for a blender 
and now we're going to customize the reply 
based on the sentiment. 
And so here the instruction is you are a customer service AI 
assistant your task is to send an email reply to about your 
customer given the customer email delimited 
by three backticks generate a reply to thank the customer for their 
review. If the sentiment is positive or neutral thank 
them for their review. If the sentiment is 
negative apologize and suggest that they can reach 
out to customer service. Make sure to use 
specific details from the review write in a 
concise and professional tone and sign the email 
as AI customer agent. And when you're using a language model to 
generate text that you're going to show to a user it's very important 
to have this kind of transparency and let 
the user know that the text they're seeing was generated 
by AI. 
And then we'll just input the customer review 
and the review sentiment. And also note that this part isn't necessarily 
important because we could actually use this prompt to 
also extract the review sentiment and then in a follow-up step write 
the email. But just for the sake of the example, well, we've already 
extracted the sentiment from the review. And so, here we have a 
response to the customer. It kind of addresses 
details that the customer mentioned in their review. 
And kind of as we instructed, suggests that they reach 
out to customer service because this is just 
an AI customer service agent. 
Next, we're going to use a parameter of the language 
model called temperature that will allow us to 
change the kind of variety of the model's responses. So you can kind of 
think of temperature as the degree of exploration 
or kind of randomness of the model. And so, for 
this particular phrase, my favourite food is the 
kind of most likely next word that the 
model predicts is pizza and the kind of next to most likely 
it suggests are sushi and tacos. And so, at 
a temperature of zero, the model will always choose the 
most likely next word, which in this case is pizza, and 
at a higher temperature, 
it will kind of also choose one of the less likely words 
and at an even higher temperature, it might even choose tacos, 
which only kind of has a five percent 
chance of being chosen. 
And you can imagine that kind of, 
as the model continues this final response, so my favourite food is 
pizza and it kind of continues to generate more words, 
this response will kind of diverge from the response, 
the first response, which is my favourite food is tacos. 
And so, as the kind of model continues, 
these two responses will become more and more different. 
In general, when building applications 
where you want a kind of predictable response, 
I would recommend using temperature zero. 
Throughout all of these videos, we've been using temperature zero and 
I think that if you're trying to build a system that is 
reliable and predictable, you should go with this. If you're trying to 
kind of use the model in a more creative way where you 
might kind of want 
a kind of wider variety of different outputs, 
you might want to use a higher temperature. So, 
now let's take this same prompt that we just used and let's try 
generating an email, but let's use a higher temperature. So, in our getCompletion 
function that we've been using throughout the videos, we have kind of 
specified a model and then also a temperature, 
but we've kind of set them to default. So, now let's try varying the 
temperature. 
So, we'll use the prompt and then 
let's try temperature 0.7. 
And so, with temperature 0, every time you execute the same prompt, 
you should expect the same completion. Whereas with temperature 0.7, you'll get 
a different output every time. So, here we have 
our email, and as you can see, it's different to the email that we 
kind of received previously. And let's just execute it again, to show 
that we'll get a different email again. 
And here we have another different email. And so, I recommend that 
you kind of play around with temperature yourself. 
Maybe you could pause the video now and 
try this prompt with a variety of different temperatures, 
just to see how the outputs vary. 
So, to summarise, at higher temperatures, 
the outputs from the model are kind of more random. 
You can almost think of it as that at higher temperatures, 
the assistant is more distractible, but maybe more creative. 
In the next video, we're going to talk more about the 
Chat Completions Endpoint format, and 
how you can create a custom chatbot using this format.
