Large language models are very good at transforming its input to a 
different format, such as inputting a 
piece of text in one language and transforming 
it or translating it to a different language, 
or helping with spelling and grammar corrections, 
so taking as input a piece of text that may not be 
fully grammatical and helping you to fix that up a bit, 
or even transforming formats such as inputting HTML and 
outputting JSON. So there's a bunch of applications that I used to write 
somewhat painfully with a bunch of regular expressions that 
would definitely be much more simply implemented now with a large language 
model and a few prompts. 
Yeah, I use Chad GPT to proofread pretty much 
everything I write these days, so I'm excited to show you 
some more examples in the notebook now. So first we'll import 
OpenAI and also 
use the same getCompletion helper function that we've 
been using throughout the videos. And the first thing we'll do 
is a translation task. So large language models are trained 
on a lot of text from kind of many sources, a lot 
of which is the internet, and this is kind of, of course, in many 
different languages. So this kind of imbues the 
model with the ability to do translation. 
And these models know kind of hundreds of languages 
to varying degrees of proficiency. And so we'll 
go through some examples of how to use this capability. 
So let's start off with something simple. 
So in this first example, the prompt is 
translate the following English text to Spanish. Hi, 
I would like to order a blender. And the response is Hola, 
me gustaría ordenar una licuadora. And I'm very sorry to all 
of you Spanish speakers. I never learned Spanish, unfortunately, 
as you can definitely tell. 
OK, let's try another example. So 
in this example, the prompt is, tell me what language this is. 
And then this is in French, Combien coûte la lampe d'air. And 
so let's run this. 
And the model has identified that this is French. 
The model can also do multiple translations at once. 
So in this example, let's say, translate the following text to 
French and Spanish. 
And you know what, let's add another an English 
pirate. 
And the text is, I want to order a basketball. 
So here we have French, Spanish, and English pirates. 
So in some languages, the translation can change 
depending on the speaker's relationship to the listener. And 
you can also explain this to the language model. And 
so it will be able to kind of translate accordingly. 
So in this example, we say, translate 
the following text to Spanish in both the 
formal and informal forms. Would you like to order a pillow? And 
also notice here, we're using a different delimiter than 
these backticks. It doesn't really matter 
as long as it's kind of a clear separation. 
So, here we have the formal and informal. 
So, formal is when you're speaking to someone who's kind 
of maybe senior to you or you're in a professional situation. That's when you 
use a formal tone and then informal is when you're speaking to maybe a 
group of friends. I don't actually speak Spanish but my dad does and he says 
that this is correct. So, for the next example, we're going 
to pretend that we're in charge of a 
 
multinational e-commerce company and so the 
user messages are going to be in all 
different languages and so users are going to be telling us about 
their IT issues in a wide variety of languages. So, we 
need a universal translator. So, first we'll just paste in a list of 
user messages in a variety of different languages 
and now we will loop through 
each of these user messages. So, for issue in user messages 
and then I'm going to copy over this slightly longer code block. 
And so, the first thing we'll do is ask the model 
to tell us what language the issue is in. So, here's the 
prompt. Then we'll print out the 
original message's language and the issue and then we'll ask 
the model to translate it into English and Korean. 
 
So, let's run this. 
So, the original message in French. 
So, we have a variety of languages and then 
the model translates them into English and then 
Korean and you can kind of see here, so the model says this is French. 
So, that's because the response from this prompt is going 
to be this is French. You could try editing this 
prompt to say something like tell me what 
language this is, respond with only one 
word or don't use a sentence, that kind of thing, if 
you wanted this to just be kind of one word. Or 
you could kind of ask for it in a JSON 
format or something like that, which would probably encourage it to 
not use a whole sentence. 
And so, amazing, you've just built a universal translator. And 
also feel free to pause the video and add kind 
of any other languages you want to try here, maybe 
languages you speak yourself and see how the model 
does. 
So the next thing we're going to dive into 
is tone transformation. Writing can vary based on kind 
of an intended audience, you know, the way that I would 
write an email to a colleague or a 
professor is obviously going to be quite different 
to the way I text my younger brother. And 
so ChatGBT can actually also help produce different tones. 
So let's look at some examples. So in this first example, the 
prompt is, translate the following from slang 
to a business letter. Dude, this is Joe, check out this spec on 
the standing lamp. 
So, let's execute this. 
And as you can see, we have a much more formal business letter 
with a proposal for a standing lamp specification. 
The next thing that we're going to do is to 
convert between different formats. ChatGBT is very good at translating between 
different formats such as JSON to HTML, you know, XML, all 
kinds of things. Markdown. 
And so in the prompt, we'll describe both the input 
and the output formats. So here is an example. So 
we have this JSON that contains a list 
of restaurant employees with their names and email. 
And then in the prompt, we're going to ask the 
model to translate this from JSON to HTML. So 
the prompt is, translate the following Python 
dictionary from JSON to an HTML table with column headers and titles. 
 
And then we'll get the response from the 
model and print it. 
So here we have some HTML displaying all 
of the employee names and emails. 
And so now let's see if we can actually view this HTML. So 
we're going to use this display function from this Python library. Display HTML 
response. 
And here you can see that this is a properly formatted HTML table. 
The next transformation task we're going to do is spell 
check and grammar checking. And this is a really kind of 
popular use for chat GBT. I highly recommend doing this. I 
do this all the time. And it's especially useful when you're working in 
a non-native language. And so here are some examples of some 
kind of common grammar and spelling problems and 
how the language model can help address these. 
So I'm going to paste in a list of sentences that have some kind 
of grammatical or spelling errors. 
 
And then we're going to loop through each of these sentences. 
And 
ask the model to proofread these. 
Proofread and correct. And then we'll use some delimiters. 
And then we will get the response and print it as usual. 
And so the model is able to correct all of these grammatical errors. 
We could use some of the techniques that we've 
discussed before. So 
to improve the prompt, we could say proofread 
and correct the following text. 
And rewrite the whole... 
And rewrite it. 
Corrected 
version. If you don't find 
any errors, 
just say 
no errors found. 
Let's try this. 
So this way we were able to... Oh, they're still using quotes here. But 
you can imagine you'd be able to find a way with a little 
bit of iterative prompt development to kind of 
find a prompt that works more reliably every 
single time. And so now we'll do another 
example. It's always useful to check your text before you 
post it in a public forum. And so we'll go through an example 
of checking a review. 
And so here is a review about a stuffed panda. 
And so we're going to ask the model to proofread and 
correct the review. 
Great. So we have this corrected version. 
And one cool thing we can do is find the kind of 
differences between our original review and the model's output. So 
we're going to use this 
RedLines Python package to do this. And we're going to get the 
diff between the original 
text of our review and the model output 
and then display this. 
And so here you can see the diff between the original review 
and the model output and the kind of 
things that have been corrected. So the prompt that we used was, uhm, 
proofread and correct this review, but you can also make 
kind of more dramatic changes, uhm, kind of changes to tone 
and that kind of thing. So, let's try 
one more thing. So in this prompt, we're going to ask the 
model to proofread and correct this same review, but 
also make it more compelling and ensure that it follows APA style 
and targets an advanced reader. And we're also 
going to ask for the output in markdown format. And so 
we're using the same text from the original review up here. So let's execute 
this. 
And here we have a expanded APA style 
review of the SoftPanda. 
So this is it for the transforming video. 
Next up we have expanding where we'll take a shorter prompt and 
kind of generate a longer, more freeform response from 
a language model.
