One of the exciting things about a large 
language model is you can use it to build a custom chatbot 
with only a modest amount of effort. ChatGPT, the web interface, 
is a way for you to have a conversational interface, 
a conversation via a large language model. But one of the 
cool things is you can also use a large language model to 
build your custom chatbot to maybe play the role of an AI 
customer service agent or an AI order taker for a restaurant. 
And in this video, you learn how to do that for yourself. 
I'm going to describe the components of 
the OpenAI ChatCompletions format in more 
detail, and then you're going to build a chatbot yourself. So let's 
get into it. So first, we'll set up the OpenAI Python package as 
usual. 
So chat models like ChatGPT are actually trained 
to take a series of messages as input 
and return a model-generated message as output. And 
so although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations 
like this easy, we've kind of seen through the previous videos 
that it's also just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversation. 
And so next, we're going to kind of define two helper functions. So 
this is the one that we've been using throughout all the videos, 
and it's the getCompletion function. But if you kind 
of look at it, we give a prompt, but then kind of 
inside the function, what we're actually doing is putting this prompt 
into what looks 
 
like some kind of user message. And this is because the 
ChatGPT model is a chat model, which means it's trained to take a series 
of messages as input and then return a model-generated message 
as output. So the user message is kind of the input, and 
then the assistant message is the output. 
So, in this video, we're going to actually use 
a different helper function, and instead of kind of 
putting a single prompt as input and getting 
a single completion, we're going to pass in a list of messages. And these 
messages can be kind of from a variety 
of different roles, so I'll describe those. So here's an example of 
a list of messages. And so, the first message is 
a system message, which kind of gives an overall instruction, and then after 
this message, we have kind of 
turns between the user and the assistant. And this would kind 
of continue to go on. And if you've ever used ChatGPT, the 
web interface, then 
your messages are the user messages, and then ChatGPT's 
messages are the assistant messages. So the system message helps 
to kind of set the behaviour and persona 
of the assistant, and it acts as kind of a high-level instruction 
for the conversation. So you can kind of think of it as whispering 
in the assistant's ear and kind of guiding it's responses without the 
user being aware of the system message. So, as the user, if 
you've ever used ChatGPT, you probably don't know what's 
in ChatGPT's system message, and that's kind of the intention. The benefit 
of the system message is that it provides you, the developer, with 
a way to kind of frame the conversation without making the 
request itself part of the conversation. So you can 
kind of guide the assistant and kind of whisper in 
its ear and guide its responses without making the user aware. 
 
So, now let's try to use these messages in a conversation. 
So we'll use our new helper function to get the 
completion from the messages. 
And we're also using a higher temperature. 
So the system message says, you are an assistant 
that speaks like Shakespeare. So this is us kind of describing to 
the assistant how it should behave. And then the first user message is, 
tell me a joke. The next is, why did the chicken cross the road? 
And then the final user message is, I don't know. 
So if we run this, 
the response is to get to the other side. Let's try again. 
To get to the other side, faire so, madame, 
tis an olden classic that never fails. So there's 
our Shakespearean response. 
And let's actually try one more thing, because 
I want to make it even clearer that 
this is the assistant message. So here, let's just 
go and print the 
entire message response. 
So, just to make this even clearer, uhm, this 
response is an assistant message. So, the role is assistant 
and then the content is the message itself. So, that's 
what's happening in this helper function. We're just 
kind of passing out the content of the message. 
now let's do another example. So, here our messages are, uhm, the 
assistant message is, you're a friendly chatbot and the first 
user message is, hi, my name is Isa. And we want to, uhm, 
 
get the first user message. So, let's execute this. The 
first assistant message. 
And so, the first message is, hello Isa, it's nice to meet you. How 
can I assist you today? 
Now, let's try another example. 
So, here our messages are, uhm, system message, you're 
a friendly chatbot and the first user message is, yes, 
can you remind me 
what is my name? And let's get the response. 
And as you can see, 
the model doesn't actually know my name. 
So, each conversation with a language model is a standalone 
interaction which means that you must provide all relevant 
messages for the model to draw from in the current conversation. 
If you want the model to draw from or, quote unquote, 
remember earlier parts of a conversation, 
you must provide the earlier exchanges in the 
input to the model. And so, we'll refer to this as context. So, let's 
try this. 
So, now we've kind of given the context that the model needs, uhm, which 
is my name in the previous messages and we'll ask 
the same question, so we'll ask what my name is. 
And the model is able to respond because it has 
all of the context it needs, uhm, in this kind of list of 
messages that we input to it. 
So now you're going to build your own chatbot. 
This chatbot is going to be called orderbot, and 
we're going to automate the collection of 
user prompts and assistant responses in order to build 
this orderbot. And it's going to take orders at a pizza restaurant, so 
first we're going to define this helper function, and what this 
is doing is it's going to kind of collect our user messages 
so we can avoid typing them in by hand in 
the same, in the way that we did above, and this is going 
to kind of collect prompts from a user 
interface that will build below, and then append it 
to a list called context, and then it will call the model with 
that context every time. And the model response 
is then also added to the context, so the kind of 
 
model message is added to the context, the user message is 
added to the context, so on, so it just kind of grows longer and 
longer. 
This way the model has the information it needs to 
determine what to do next. And so now we'll 
set up and run this kind of UI to display the order bot, and 
so here's the context, and it contains the system message that 
contains the menu, 
and note that every time we call the language model we're 
going to use the same context, and the context is building 
up over time. 
And then let's execute this. 
Okay, I'm going to say, hi, I would like to order a pizza. 
And the assistant says, great, what pizza would you like to order? 
We have pepperoni, cheese, and eggplant pizza. 
How much are they? 
Great, okay, we have the prices. 
I think I'm feeling a medium eggplant pizza. 
So as you can imagine, we could kind of continue this conversation, 
and let's kind of look at what we've put in the system message. 
So you are order bot, an automated service 
to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. 
You first greet the customer, then collect the order, 
and then ask if it's a pickup or delivery. You 
wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check 
for a final time if the customer wants 
to add anything else. If it's a delivery, you can 
ask for an address. Finally, you collect the payment. Make sure 
to clarify all options, extras, and sizes 
to uniquely identify the item from the menu. You respond 
in a short, very conversational, friendly style. 
The menu includes, and then here we have the menu. 
So let's go back to our conversation and let's see 
if the assistant kind of has been following the instructions. 
Okay, great, the assistant asks if we want any toppings 
which we kind of specified an assistant message. 
So I think we want no extra toppings. 
Things... sure thing. Is there anything else we'd 
like to order? Hmm, 
let's get some water. Actually, 
fries. 
Small or large? And this is great because we kind of 
asked the assistant in the system message to 
kind of clarify extras and sides. 
And so you get the idea and please feel free 
to play with this yourself. You can pause the video and just go 
ahead and run this in your own notebook on the left. 
And so now we can ask the model to create a JSON 
summary that we could send to the order 
system based on the conversation. 
So we're now appending another system message which is an 
instruction and we're saying create a JSON summary of 
the previous food order, itemize the price for each item, the fields 
should be one pizza, include side, 
two lists of toppings, three lists of drinks, 
and four lists of sides, and finally the total price. 
And you could also 
use a user message here, this does not have to be a system 
message. 
So let's execute this. 
And notice in this case we're using a lower 
temperature because for these kinds of tasks we want 
the output to be fairly predictable. For 
a conversational agent you might want to use 
a higher temperature, however in this case I 
would maybe use a lower temperature as well 
because for a customer's assistant chatbot you might want 
the output to be a bit more predictable as well. 
And so here we have the summary of our order and so 
we could submit this to the order system if we wanted to. 
So there we have it, you've built your very own order chatbot. Feel 
free to kind of customize it yourself and play around with the 
system message to kind of change the behavior of the chatbot and 
kind of get it to act as different personas 
with different knowledge.
